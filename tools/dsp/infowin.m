function [argout] = infowin(wintype,infoflag)
%INFOWIN stores information about windows.
%   [OUT] = INFOWIN(WINTYPE, INFOFLAG) returns information about the
%   WINTYPE window specified by INFOFLAG. WINTYPE must be numeric ranging
%   between 1 and 7. Type INFOWIN(#,'NAME') for the name of the window
%   corresponding to WINTYPE = #.
%
%   INFOFLAG must be one of the character arrays below specifying ARGOUT.
%
%   NAME window name.
%   NAME outputs a character array with the name of the window that
%   corresponds to the numerical flag WINTYPE
%
%   DEN constant overlap-add (COLA) denominator.
%   A WINTYPE window is COLA(R) if it has the constant overlap-add
%   property at hop size R = M/DEN, expressed as a fraction of the window
%   size M.
%
%   SUM constant amplitude COLA.
%   A WINTYPE window sums to a constant factor SUM when overlap-added at
%   COLA(R).
%
%   MLW main lobe width in frequency bins.
%   MLW is the width of the main-lobe of a WINTYPE window in frequency
%   bins.
%
%   SLL highest side-lobe level in dB.
%   SLL is the amplitude in dB of the second side-lobe for a WINTYPE
%   window. SLL is related to the minimum amplitude a nearby sinusoid can
%   have to be detected.
%
%   SLFO side-lobe fall-off in dB per octave.
%   The SLFO is the rate in dB at which the amplitude of the spectral
%   side-lobes attenuate per octave for a WINTYPE window.
%
%   CSF cepstral smoothing factor.
%   CSF is the factor used to estimate the order in cepstral smoothing that
%   compensates for using windows other than rectangular.
