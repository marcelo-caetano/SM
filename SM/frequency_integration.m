%FREQUENCY_INTEGRATION Integrates the frequency of the current frame
%with the next frame into a time-varying phase track.

%   [S,P,H,A,F] = FREQUENCY_INTEGRATION(Ac,An,Fc,Fn,Pp,T,SR)
%   integrates the frequencies of the current and next frames of a
%   sinusoidal model into a time-varying phase track. The input parameters are:
%
%   Ac is the current amplitude and An is the next amplitude.
%   Fc is the current frequency and Fn is the next frequency.
%   Pp is the last phase value (argument of sinusoid) of the previous frame.
%   T is the time elapsed between the center pf the previous frame and the
%   center of the current frame (i.e., the frame advance or hopsize).
%   SR is the sampling rate.
%
%   S is the final synthetic signal over T.
%   P has the phase integrated over T.
%   H contains the partials that comprise S when summed.
%   A has the amplitudes linearly interpolated over T.
%   F the frequencies linearly interpolated over T.
